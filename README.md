Mini Project - Webscrapping-Using-Python 

Introduction:
Web scraping is the process of collecting or extracting data from the web. It’s also known as crawling, spidering and web harvesting sometimes. Simply copying data from internet can also be termed as web scraping but generally when we talk about scraping the web, we are referring to an automated process wherein we can scrape data by writing a programming script.

Libraries used for webscraping:
* Requests Library for Web Scraping – It is used for making various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, etc. It is the most basic yet the most essential of all libraries.
* Beautiful Soup Library for Web Scraping – Its work involves creating a parse tree for parsing content. A perfect starting library for beginners and very easy to work with.
* Selenium Library for Web Scraping – Originally made for automated testing of web applications, this library overcomes the issue all the above libraries face i.e. scraping content from dynamically populated websites

Installations:
requests
bs4
chromedriver 


Editor Used:
Visual Studio Code
CSV file
powershell

Conclusion:
We used the Beautiful Soup library to parse html data and convert it into a form that can be used for analysis.
